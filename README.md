# BotGru
**HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED TO YOU?**
  You're sitting in your chair one night, chatting with friends on Discord, when 
all of a sudden you remember that you had an important thing to do next week. 
You make a reminder on your calendar app and move on. Then theday comes and you 
get a notification on your phone. Absent mindedly, you slide the notification
away and you never see it again. The day passes and all of a sudden someone is
yelling at you that you forgot that one thing. Well you know where you always
spend all your time? Discord. You know what you can't just absent mindedly slide
away? A Discord dm from a bot. That's where Bot Gru comes in. 

  This bot features a database that you save reminders and events to, and will 
message you when it's time to remind you of said reminder/event. It also has a 
digest feature to remind you of events you may have every day/week/month. So add
this bot to a server and/or dm him now, and try it out today!

(Don't put private information and whatnot and also im not responsible for me
accidentally messing up the database at any time and having to scrap it)
