# BotGru
**HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED TO YOU?**
</br>     You're sitting in your chair one night, chatting with friends on Discord, when all of a sudden you remember that you had an important thing to do next week. You make a reminder on your calendar app and move on. Then theday comes and you get a notification on your phone. Absent mindedly, you slide the notificationaway and you never see it again. The day passes and all of a sudden someone is yelling at you that you forgot that one thing. Well you know where you alwaysspend all your time? Discord. You know what you can't just absent mindedly slide away? A Discord dm from a bot. That's where Bot Gru comes in. 
</br>     This bot features a database that you save reminders and events to, and will message you when it's time to remind you of said reminder/event. It also has a digest feature to remind you of events you may have every day/week/month. So add this bot to a server and/or dm him now, and try it out today!

</br>(Don't put private information and whatnot and also im not responsible for me accidentally messing up the database at any time and having to scrap it)
